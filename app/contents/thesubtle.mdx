<span className='text-4xl mr-1'>I</span> cannot stress enough how important it is for you to read Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. The lessons in this book taught me to stop caring about my past and start living in the present. The trick to "not giving a f\*ck" is to choose carefully which things you care about. Opportunities and options abound in the world we now inhabit. The author demonstrates how we might learn to prioritize our time and energy effectively.

The best use of your time and energy is spent on something you find to be essential and meaningful in your life. Because of the difficulties inherent in everyone's life, it is essential to establish personal significance in order to maintain the motivation to work through those difficulties. As a result, we might conclude that the secret to happiness is not caring about a wider range of issues, but rather caring deeply just about those that are in line with one's own ideals.
