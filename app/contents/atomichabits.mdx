    This is the first book I have ever bought for myself, and I couldn't be happier that James Clear's Atomic Habits has
    taken the internet by storm.

    If you're the type of person who's easily discouraged by fatigue and sloth, this book will show you how to overcome
    such traits and become a stronger, more capable version of yourself. This book provides rules for improving oneself
    through routines, and the most fascinating aspect is hearing their personal tales, which provide motivation because
    they so closely mirror my own.

The book has had a profound impact on my life; I am able to establish new, positive routines while simultaneously kicking some undesirable ones. If you want to form good habits and break negative ones, you should read the rules of Atomic Habits. No matter how big or small your habits are today, they will have a significant impact on your life in the near future. This is especially true if you, like me, spend time each day in the gym working out; if you go once every couple of weeks or so, you won't notice any changes in your body, but if you stick with it for six or eight months, you will notice changes in your body, depending on what you're working on. My point is that if we believe we are making progress, we should keep at it even if we don't see immediate results. The more we learn and grow, the more progress we make, and the better it is.

Excellent work, James Clear. Loved reading your stuff.
