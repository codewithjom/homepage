  <span className='text-4xl mr-1'>T</span>he fact that James Clear's Atomic Habits, the very first book I ever bought
  for myself, has been such a smashing success makes me really delighted. Although I used to enjoy reading novels when I
  was younger, it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I started getting back into the practice of doing so. I was
  ecstatic to come across this book on a list of books that were recommended for enhancing productivity online, and I
  now recommend it to everyone who is interested in reading a book for the very first time.
</p>

<p>
  The first four laws are the most effective means of establishing new, positive routines and eliminating old, harmful
  ones. James gave us the historical context of each rule, prompting introspection on my part and, I hope, on yours as
  well. Going to the gym and working out is the only routine I've been able to pick back up again since the pandemic in
  2019.
</p>

<p>
  If you're the type of person who's easily discouraged by fatigue and sloth, this book will show you how to overcome
  such traits and become a stronger, more capable version of yourself. This book provides rules for improving oneself
  through routines, and the most fascinating aspect is hearing their personal tales, which provide motivation because
  they so closely mirror my own.
</p>

<p>
  The book has had a profound impact on my life; I am able to establish new, positive routines while simultaneously
  kicking some undesirable ones. If you want to form good habits and break negative ones, you should read the rules of
  Atomic Habits. No matter how big or small your habits are today, they will have a significant impact on your life in
  the near future. This is especially true if you, like me, spend time each day in the gym working out; if you go once
  every couple of weeks or so, you won't notice any changes in your body, but if you stick with it for six or eight
  months, you will notice changes in your body, depending on what you're working on. My point is that if we believe we
  are making progress, we should keep at it even if we don't see immediate results. The more we learn and grow, the more
  progress we make, and the better it is.

<p>Excellent work, James Clear. Loved reading your stuff.</p>
